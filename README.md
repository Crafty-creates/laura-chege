### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Laurah Chege. I do cloud things. 

. ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on CI/CD and Infra Automation (focus is on DevOps)...

. ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m occasionally learning on stuff to do with technical writing. 

. âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy involving automation in almost everything I do (they call it working smart).

. âš¡ Everything is art if you think a little more about it. Crafty-creates sounds cool, no ?
